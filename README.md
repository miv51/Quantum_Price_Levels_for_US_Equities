# Quantum_Price_Levels_for_US_Equities
Python implementation of an adaptation of the quantum price levels described in Lee's 2020 Quantum finance book.

The notebook <code/>Quantum_Price_Levels_Calc.ipynb</code> provides a python implementation and a step-by-step explaination to perform the calculation.

The python script <code/>Dash_App_Qpls_Calc.py</code> provides the ability to select a ticker symbol to display a candlestick chart dashboard that shows the quantum price levels nearest to the last closing price in the 1 and 5-minute timeframes, recent historical chart data, and the distribution of relative returns of daily stock prices in the form of a dash application.
